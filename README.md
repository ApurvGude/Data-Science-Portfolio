Repository containing a portfolio of all the Data Science Projects I have done for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

## 1. [Selling Used Cars](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Selling-Used-Cars)

In this project, we made a model to predict when a user should sell his used car to maximise his profits. The model was made using data from 100000 cars from 10 different companies with various features such as engine size,fuel used, mpg and model of the car. We were able to obtain a R2 score of 0.96 on the validation dataset/

## 2. [Predicting Movie Success](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Predicting-Movie-Success)

The goal of this project is to predict how succesful a Bollywood movie will be in the box office before its release. We were given a dataset of over 1300 movies released from 2001 to 2014 with various features for each movie such as release date,genre,cast and crew involved and so on. We were able to make a classifier which gave us a ROC AUC score of 0.79 on the validaiton dataset.

## 3. [Song Genre Prediction](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Song-genre-prediction)

In this project, we scraped song lyrics of 46 artists from 7 different genres off the internet.Using this data,we made a model to predict which genre a specific line of text is from. We used different NLP techniques such as Lemmatization, POS tagging, TF-IDF vectorizer and Word2Vec embeddings to create our model which obtained a ROC AUC score of 0.84.

## 4. [Predicting College Placement Salaries](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Predicting-College-Placements)

We created a model to predict the starting salaries of a engineering college graduate. The training data consists of 4500 graduates with factors such as Degree,Specialization, College Tier, State and so on provided for each candidate. Using this data,we trained our regressor model which obtained a RMSE of around 13500.

## 5. [Miniprojects](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects)

This is a repository of some smaller projects I have done on Kaggle or as a part of coursework.
